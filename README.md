I am a highly skilled and motivated software engineer passionate about developing innovative solutions. 

My expertise lies in Frontend development in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Typescript, React and in more interlinked technologies. Capable of building awesome web applications, I am currently diving deeper into the backend part of web development.

Knowing the basics of Computer Science, I am currently continuing down that route for my HSC level. Being a self-taught engineer, I am currently spending on average 30 hours a week mastering and keeping updated with newer technologies.

My current projects at the time include an e-commerce store, namely 'Indeskticate'.

Check my GitHub for more information and let's connect for other opportunities.
